        Today I wanted to talk about an album that I have been enjoying lately: the last album of Madlib “Sound Ancestors”. The vibe of this album reminds me of the fantastic albums of J Dilla (who was also Madlib’s friend), composed of a bunch of loops and samples magically coming together into a coherent whole.
        <br>Each song is a proposal of its own universe, like a small insight on something bigger. You take it or leave it but whatever you choose, a sharp cut ending and you're onto the next song. It is spontaneous and you have to leave the album lead the way.

        Perceiving it like this might make it sound chaotic or random, but that is really not what it is about. I would say it is more like listening to one story told through different perspectives. The songs on their own do not necessarily make so much sense, and it is when they come together that their full potential is revealed. A lot of voice samples, some hip hop rhythmics, jazzy atmospheres here and there which immediately brought me back to the feeling of sitting in a jazz bar, and if you pay attention you will definitely recognize reggae and dub influences.

        Madlib from his real name Otis Jackson Jr. is an American DJ, producer, MC and has been very influential in the hip hop and jazz spheres of the past 20 years. The beginning of his career was mainly focusing on jazz, as a part of the band Yesterday’s New Quintet. The group released a few albums, although funny enough, the band was only composed of Madlib who was playing all the instruments under different aliases.
        <br>At the same time he worked as producer, and soon started collaborating with other producers and rappers, some of them being all time geniuses such as J Dilla, Mos Def or MF Doom. Traveling a lot, he has always released from every corner of the world, constantly creating, and looks like that is what he is always remembered for.
