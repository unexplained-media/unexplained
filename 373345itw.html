        In the past two years I have spent in the Hague, I’ve had time to discover and slowly get to know the local cultural scene (although the current global pandemic for sure did not help). Although many complain about how nothing is going on here, I don’t think it is necessarily true and thought it would be interesting to document the initiatives that are going on in the city, learn more about its people and their ideas.
        <br>
        <br>
        The first place I wanted to do this with is the record store 3345, not only because I know some of the people working there and can already tell you they’re really cool people, but also because they’ve been really making a name for themselves in the past two years the store has been physically open.
        Selections of new and 2nd records, a great diversity of genres, an important presence online with different content on facebook and instagram, also curating cultural events, small concerts, parties or online dj sets. It seems they can do it all and looks like it’s only the beginning.
        <br>
        <br>
        I recently had the chance to have a conversation with two members of the team, Sameer and Luuk: from what it means owning a record store to their relationship to music or the cultural scene in the Hague, continue reading for the entire discussion.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Lou</b>: I’ve heard that the beginnings of the store were at Leiden, what motivated you to properly settle in the Hague?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Well we are all from the Hague. We all grew up here, together also. We all knew each other from highschool.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: I think from partying!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah from partying but we knew each other in highschool already, everyone knew each other. And Gunnar (ed: another member of the team) was actually in my highschool, he was in my year. There is actually this really funny story; I was playing at this party that we have at the end of the school year. I was playing for the year above or something and then Gunnar came up to me and was like “yeah what are you playing?” and I was like “this” and then we became bff. So yeah since high school. Eddy (ed: used to work at the store as well) was also in that highschool.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: The craziest thing with Eddy is that the 2nd week working together we discovered we grew up in the same street.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: Were there elements in the process of opening and sustaining the store that were really unexpected, that when you look back on it you thought “wow I never thought running a record store would mean doing this”?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Well a lot. But I have to say that we have a lot of experience surrounding us, especially from Mark. So the kind of stuff we encountered was more like “oh yeah that’s what they’re always talking about”. We weren’t thrown in the deep, we had good systems around us that were already working so we got to learn a lot from it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: Mark has been buying records since the 80s and owned record stores before so he taught us a lot about this.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: The record market has obviously largely reduced since the apparition of CD and streaming, is it challenging to find a clientele?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: Because we were online we already had a fixed clientele, but that was in Leiden mostly. But moving to the Hague, yeah we always talk about these things. How can you get people that walk through the streets to find you, I think it is tougher than 30 years ago.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: You are also quite present online, notably with the facebook group although I saw a couple of days ago that you guys are changing to an email system I think?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah just with the updates. It is just that it takes a lot of time and energy to maintain a one to one contact so we are changing the daily updates to email.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: But how did the facebook group start originally? Because I feel like it’s quite specific and not everyone that walks in the store knows about it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: It’s not closed but we keep it limited because we want to have a certain level of control and trust because if it was open it would be too much to handle. I think it started because a friend of ours had a record store here in the Hague, and he had a Facebook group. Then he quit and we had just started in Leiden with buying records. And he was like “I would love for you guys to continue the process”, but then it was still very small. So we pumped up the volume, added more people and started to concentrate more on dance I think, because before it was a bit more experimental and electronic. We started pushing a certain branch of dance that was really coming up at that time. And yeah it kind of became a hit or something. It really worked well but the system was really bad so we had to make a whole custom system around it and now it works.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: It was around 2017.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah now four years, right?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: You guys have new records, 2nd hand, a great diversity of genre while keeping it quite sharp in the selection, how do you choose the records that are going to be sold in the shop?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Well there is a big difference between 2nd hand and new. 2nd hand just comes by chance and you sell what you have. For new you have a big network of distribution to work with and you make the selection yourself. But yeah that’s just knowing your customers and knowing yourself.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: So it’s quite a natural process.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah you get a feel for it you know. Sometimes you think a record will sell really well and it won’t, and then sometimes you miss a record. I think it’s the make or break part because it’s not only choosing the right record, it’s managing the cash flow to get all the records, managing the contact to get it in time, managing the quantities. So yeah we are mostly focusing on that now and getting that system better.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: And I feel like within the team you have pretty diverse music tastes, and if that’s the case do you feel like it can come as an obstacle sometimes or do you see it more as a complementary thing?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>:: I think overall we have pretty much the same taste, we go to the same venues. On a commercial level we have our own distributions so everyone has their own input in what they bring to the table.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think in the big picture we are all on the same page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: Yeah I’m always curious what the other guys and girls bring to the table, there’s a big chance that something I’m going to pay a lot in a store is purchased by James and vice versa. I think we all have the same vision of what we need for the store.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: I was wondering how do you guys deal with such an amount of music that is coming out all the time? I feel like there’s often this dilemma between the sort of treasure hunt, always looking for the next best thing but also coming back to the music you know and that you like. How do you balance those things, do you find it hard?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think for me, it’s kind of like a stemina you build with listening, because we’ve consumed a lot of music in our lives. I can listen to a lot of music and really go through it without turning crazy. But yeah I think it’s just something you have to build up. Learning to listen with your eyes is also very important. Sometimes you can just see it, you can read the cover and the context of the record, there is just a lot of experience that goes into this that you just build up over time. I think the main thing is that you are able to sit, listen and search for music for hours. Luuk is just crazy (laughs). I can also just sit and go through music for a long period of time. Just go one by one, listen to all the tracks.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: Do you manage to still keep it as a pleasure? I feel like the more you listen to music, the more you get in that mentality of looking for something, and it’s hard to just feel the music without thinking “oh I could play this at a gig” or “I could sell that”.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I always feel it. If it does something to me I feel it. What happens sometimes is that it’s not really up your street and you sort of miss it in the context of the record. That happens but if it’s made for you, you always feel it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: Yesterday I was looking for the new Spellling record, and I had already ordered it, and I saw a new single then I got enthusiastic like “we need to get more”. So you just get enthusiastic, also about exciting artists and what they could bring.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I get where you’re coming from though, like it’s a real thing to feel that way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: Yeah I was just wondering because the other day I had a conversation with this dj based in Amsterdam, and sort of asked her the same question. She told me that sometimes she just needs a break because she feels a bit overwhelmed and after a few days she comes back to it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: No breaks here, never! (laughs) But I also just think it’s your job you know. That’s how I think. If I don’t like it, I just think that I need to get through it.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: I often hear that there is not so much going on in the cultural scene in the Hague, what are your thoughts on this and do you think it is bound to stay that way?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think there is not much happening party wise, comparable to Amsterdam or Rotterdam because it’s just a different city, it’s a different way of consuming the music here. I think it’s smaller and art focused here and centered around a couple of institutions. It’s not necessarily a bad thing but if you want to party, then it is sometimes a good place but there are other places for that. But I think it works well together with Amsterdam and Rotterdam, I just see it as one big city. So if you really want to go big warehouse raving, yeah the Hague is not the place for that. But there is a lot of very interesting experimental stuff here and especially if you look at the context of the conservatory, or festivals like Rewire. Even Rewire, you don’t go there to go crazy, just go there for a very interesting and cool experience and I think it works very well within that particular context.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: So would you say it is just a different way of experiencing the music here?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think it is very healthy and it’s alright, but people who make this assumption which I can understand, they are comparing it with other places. Then of course there is something lacking but if you see it in its own light then I think there is a lot to discover.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: But I feel like they’re also comparing it to what the Hague used to be.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah but I was talking about this the other day. How do you know what it used to be? Same about those crazy assumptions of how techno used to be. I don’t know. I can only hear stories from old guys, mostly old guys. You know they say everything used to be better but a lot of things weren’t good back then.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: Do you guys have any music recommendations?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: Yeah every week on Friday, we select eight albums! (ed: to be found on their instagram account <a href="https://www.instagram.com/3345_thehague/">here</a>)
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think overall it is a good period for dance music, I see a healthy balance between re-issues and new records. I think it will only become better, with more laid back Corona now everyone is dropping their hottest production. I am very excited for that, it is going to be a very exciting period.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: This question gets tougher the longer you think about it. I think this year I’ve been enjoying the live performance of the Pet Shop Boys, and what sells this week was Greentea Peng that we played the other day in the store and we got positive reactions. But every week we select eight records that we think are interesting and those also represent our own tastes.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: The weekly highlights always surprise me, because of how high the quality of the releases are every week and that we have in the store.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: Who selects those albums that you promote every week, is it the whole team?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah the whole team.
        <br>

        <div class="article-text">
        <b>Lou</b>: We’re getting closer to the end, do you have any perspectives in the future for the store?
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah a lot!
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: This year was a lot online so make it physical again, people want to talk to each other’s face.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: The two years that we’ve been here were mainly focused on getting the store working and I think that’s done now. So we can focus more on events, merchandise. We’re going to do some merchandise and in-house projects like labels or related people we want to support who release some music. I think it’s going to be focusing more on our own output.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: And this is the last question, you guys have been doing quite a lot of real life events when it was possible or streams when everything was online. Is it important for you guys to contribute to the cultural scene in more than “just” a record store.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think it comes hand in hand, we love music, from a young age we have evolved in music, and naturally when you have a place you also want to support the community in a way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: And there are people that know each other through the store and that are now doing music together and I think that is very important. I’m happy that this place is here and that people can run into each other, people that otherwise would have never met each other. I think it’s different from meeting people online, it’s more random. If you meet people online it’s gonna be through a forum or a website. It’s based on similar interests. And here sometimes you see people talk to each other for half an hour and you just know that wouldn’t happen otherwise. They go to the store for totally different products but then end up talking to each other. And it’s already been two years so that’s pretty cool.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I think it just goes naturally. I always felt from the beginning we wanted to have a place that doesn’t superimpose something on people but can grow with people. And I think we succeeded in the way that we are very open. It’s never a monologue, it’s always a dialogue between you and the customers, and I think that’s also very healthy for your store because you grow together with your customers. So if they grow in taste, you can also listen to them, in the end it’s all about keeping a good energy.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: So community is definitely important.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah, I don’t want to throw that word around easily (laughs) but it is a community in a way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Luuk</b>: But with the word community it almost sounds like something closed and it’s important in a place like this to know that everyone is actually welcome. That can be the idea of this community that everyone is welcome and can come here, and if you come here, there are possibilities to meet people and talk about music, and to sell your products, all these things.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: I don’t know … like a place in Pokemon or something! I think the word community is it, but it’s also the danger with a lot of concepts and things that you try to superimpose on people. In a way we always do because we determine what we sell here but we try to have it very open for input. So also the Facebook group, it’s not like we say what’s going to be sold ,you can also put in a request and now the request sell themselves now.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: I think you guys are pretty flexible with how you deal with the store overall.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Sameer</b>: Yeah and I think that is what I was missing. You see a lot of stores that have been around for a long time and get kind of trapped in a certain sound or a frame of people that work there, and get sort of unaware. It’s very funny how these things work.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Lou</b>: Cool! Thank you guys
