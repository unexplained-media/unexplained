      <h2>9 soundtrack composers for a diverse representation</h2>
      <br>
      <h5>written by Lou Touyarou</h5>

      <div class="article-text">
        From the many underrated things that exist on this planet, soundtrack composers have to be considered as one of them.
        <br>I am always so surprised and amazed when I discover a new soundtrack composer. How come a vast majority of us have never heard their names although they play such an important role in creating a universe and atmosphere in our favorite movies, sometimes making millions of entries, and still not having their name known to the wider audience?
        <br>
        <br>
        I could go on with this article and tell you wonders about the talent of people like Hans Zimmer, Alexandre Desplat or John Williams. I could because their compositions are powerful, emotional and have always managed to make me travel in the universe they create.
        <br>
        <br>
        I could but I won’t. I won’t simply because just like any industry really, the scene is still majorly dominated by white males (shook right?). If you take the first few links that come up when you type “Best soundtrack composers” on Google, you can find rankings such as Music Production HQ’s “50 best soundtrack composers”. When you look at it closer what do you see? 46 of them come from either the US or a european country and are white. Not a single one of them are women. More or less the same story when you take IMDB ranking. You might think that this is just a stupid ranking on internet, but the truth is that this is just the representation of a bigger issue. For example, according to a study conducted by the University of Southern California conducted in 2018, from the top 100 fiction films at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017, 16 composers were women, 1218 were men. I think you get the picture here.
        <br>
        <br>
        So my question is where are the women? Where are the people of color? Where are composers from “non-western countries”?
        They surely exist, you just need to be really looking for them.
        Here’s a non-exhaustive list of some of them, the choice was tough to make because there are so many talented artists out there. Who knows, this might lead to a part 2 in the future!

        <b>久石 譲 (Joe Hisaishi)</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Japanese composer, band-master, pianist, lyricist, Joe Hisaishi’s talent is largely recognized around the world and is probably not the one most in need of public recognition. I still wanted to mention him because it’s safe to say that he has made some of all time favourite movie soundtracks.
        Working very closely with Studio Ghibli and more precisely with Miyazaki, he composed most the soundtrack of most of his movies, featuring all time masterpieces such as “Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind”, “Princess Mononoke”, “Castle In The Sky”, “Howl’s Moving Castle”, “Ponyo” and many more. He also worked with Takahata composing the soundtrack of “The Tale Of The Princess Kaguya”, or with Kitano on “Sonatine”, “Brothers” and “Dolls”.
        In the 2000s, his career took an international turn working on movies from France, Hong Kong or Korea.
        Such a success does not come as a surprise to those that already know his music. How to even give his music the description it deserves?
        All I can say is that it is majestic, with an incredible ability to transform emotions into melodies which will make you remember all the beauty and poesy there is in the world. It is so right every time, Hisaishi never fails at bringing you in the story he’s telling.

        <b>菅野 よう子 (Yoko Kanno)</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yoko Kanno is a Japanese composer, mainly known for her work in animation, especially for the soundtrack of the brilliant anime and movies Cowboy Bebop (realized by Shinichiro Watanabe, definitely a must watch), working as compositor but also leading the band “The Seatbelts'' founded on purpose for the creation of the soundtrack. The soundtrack has an interesting variety of genres going from jazz to rock, with some blues from time to time. It can be very energetic, with a lot of trumpets and fast rhythmics, or calmer with melodies from a lonely saxophone, guitar chords of a gentle summer night, combinations that represent very well the different emotions you can feel when watching Cowboy Bebop.
        <br>She has also worked on the soundtrack of animes such as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone, Macross Plus also realized by Watanabe and many more. Her soundtracks are very different from one movie to another, it feels like she completely adapts completely to the universe of the movie she is working on.

          <b>இளையராஜா (Ilaiyaraaja)</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          Composer, actor and scenarist, Ilaiyaraaja is known for his intense creativity having composed soundtracks for more than a 1000 movies (yes, you read it, a 1000) more or less equivalent to the creation of three songs a day.
          Everytime I went to listen to his music I felt like I was listening to a different artist. Sometimes made of echoey voices    over a drum line reminiscent of dub or very old school rap, sometimes what you would imagine as the typical Bollywood music, sometimes with funky synthesizers sounding like Indian 70s disco. It gave me the feeling I was only scratching the surface of something big, the music of someone that has undoubtedly changed the music industry in India although completely overlooked by the rest of the world.
          I very much recommend getting lost in his music and all the compilations, links and videos there are available because it is absolutely fascinating, and feels like opening a door across time.

        <b> Angela Morley</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Angela Morley is a British composer and bandmaster, but is also the first transgender person to be nominated for an oscar. She has worked as orchestrator and ghost-writer on the soundtracks of huge productions such as E.T., Star Wars, Schindler’s list, Home Alone or Superman. Besides her collaborations, she also created soundtracks in her own rights, notably for movies such as The Watership Down, Captain Nemo and the Underwater city or Madam X.
        <br>Her music dates back to the beginning of the 50s, which explains her classical approach, always composed of majestic melodies performed by an orchestra. I find her compositions very touching, there is something that I’m struggling to pinpoint, but there is something in her music that carries you away, making you swing to the rhythm of the violins and throwing you back to the orchestral music of the past century.

        <b>坂本 龍一 (Ryuichi Sakamoto)</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Before evolving in his solo career, Sakamoto is a member of the band Yellow Magic Orchestra also known as YMO. The band is largely influenced by artists such as Kraftwek, using a lot of synthesizers, creating more and more music from computers, and are considered to have importantly contributed to the development of synthpop across the world.
        <br>
        <br>Next to YMO, Sakamoto evolves in his solo career trying out very different styles and collaborating with a lot of artists, including repeated collaboration with the German electronic music producer, Alva Noto for example.
        He also composes many movie soundtracks, the most famous ones being for Furyo (Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence) of Nagisa Oshima with a very touching theme played at the piano, but also The Last Emperor of Bernado Bertolucci, or The Revenant of Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu once more, coming as the result of one of his collaborations with Alva Noto.

        <b>Fatima Al Qadiri</b>
          <br>
          <br>
        Fatima Al Qadiri is a DJ and producer of electronic music originally from Kuwait and born in Senegal. She composed in 2019 the soundtrack of the movie “Atlantics” directed by Mati Diop. It particularly caught my attention because of its peculiar atmosphere, very ambient, sounding almost surnatural. The movie deals with issues such as immigration, grief, class struggle and you can feel the tragedy of these issues through the music. There is a sort of long, heavy but also beautiful sadness coming out of the soundtrack, and made me realize that it is quite rare to find soundtracks with such an electronic sound to them.

        <b>Miriam Cutler</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Miriam Cutler is an American soundtrack composer, her passion for documentary leading her to mainly compose for non-fiction movies. She has been a member of film festival juries numerous times and her love for jazz has pushed her to work with jazz legends such as Joe Williams, Nina Simone or Marlena Shaw.
        In 2014, she also co-founded the Alliance for Women Film Composers, aiming for more visibility and representation for women in the field.
        I find it really interesting to listen to her music through the prism of documentaries, I don’t know why but knowing that the music is attached to a documentary, showing real events or explaining facts, somehow being linked with reality makes me hear the music slightly differently; and it makes me wonder if the process of creation of soundtracks is different from the ones of fiction or nonfiction movies.

        <b>Herbie Hancock</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          You might know Herbie Hancock for his impressive career as a pianist, really influential in the jazz sphere, also playing for some time in the Miles Davis Quintet (Miles Davis who also composed a gorgeous soundtrack for “Ascenseur pour L'échafaud”). However it is with his own band and album “Headmaster” that his career exploded. His creations were innovative in the sense that they were blending jazz with influences from different styles, such as blues, rock, funk, his music from one album to another is extremely diverse and that was very original.
          However we often tend to forget that he has also worked on different movie soundtracks, one of them being for “Round’ Midnight” for which he received an Oscar for best music, but also for Blow Up, Colors of Harlem Nights.
