        With its incredibly sweet sound, “2nd” exit is an album (and also the name of the duo) I keep coming back to. With soothing voices, sometimes singing, sometimes almost speaking, and light rhytmics and melodies, its composition, overall quite minimalistic, will make you feel like you are floating. There is something to this album that just makes it feel like a safe space and is one that never disappoints.

        The duo is based in London, and behind the name “2nd exit” actually stand the two artists Alfa Mist and Lester Salmins. They both cumulate many different roles, Lester being a musician, producer, songwriter, and engineer, while Alfa is also a musician, producer and composer.

        I already knew Alfa Mist, or his work at least, and have listened a lot to some of his albums, mainly to “Epoch” or “Structuralism”. His are also albums that I always come back to, and when I think about it, totally explains why I appreciate 2nd exit so much.
        When you listen to his music you can obviously hear the jazz inspiration in his music, especially in his earlier albums; but he manages to give a second breath to the genre, mixing it with rhythmics and voices familiar to hip-hop. You might think that this is not really anything new, but whereas jazz is often put at the service of hip-hop, in his music it feels like it goes both ways, and hip-hop can be as much at the service of jazz. As his music evolves there is more singing, usually very melodious female voices although he raps as well, the sound of the arrangements get clearer, as if it was becoming lighter and airier with time. This is really well done in his last, and also probably my favorite album “Epoch”, featuring the british singer Emmavie.

        I wasn’t familiar with Lester Salmin’s work, probably because he does not have any solo releases and worked mainly on technical aspects of albums. He does also work as an instrumentalist, on one of Alfa Mist’s early albums “Antiphon” for example. He also considerably participated in the creation process of Jordan Rakei’s album “Cloak” (very good as well), working as producer, musician, and has participated in the writing as well.

        This was only a small insight on some of the many (really, there a lot) talents in the musical scene of London, where the jazz scene is quite prominent.
