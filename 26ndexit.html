        This album, as the title can let you guess, is a diverse compilation of dancefloor music from Cape Verde with a selection made by Arp Frique and Americo Brito. Arp Frique is a band based in Rotterdam with a music style hard to categorize, it doesn’t really fit in a particular genre. It’s quite groovy with a lot of synthesizers, a mix between 70s disco and modern house, a lot of energy comes out of their music!

          Also worked on this selection Americo Brito, a recognized artist in the Rotterdam’s music scene. Originally from Cape Verde, Americo Brito quickly entered the music scene when he arrived in Rotterdam, first performing with his band Djarama, but eventually started hosting a radio show made of Cape Verdean music, which grew bigger over time and happened to be a big sucess. Cape Verdean migration has happened all over the world, often in cities with big harbors, which explains why Rotterdam has become such a popular destination and where Cape Verdean music is quite present.

            This compilation is not only about Cape Verdean music in Rotterdam, but shows the diversity of Cape Verdean music all across the world which makes listening to this album a rich experience.
            <br>
            The selection is quite diverse and takes you along Cape Verdean treasures going from disco to funk, but also with some Funana or Coladeira, both music genres originally from Cape Verde. According to Arp Frique you will find on this album “dancefloor hits and beloved radio gems known in the Cape Verdean scene by both a young and old generation, undiscovered yet by the “bigger” audience.”
            <br>
            The album is really refreshing to listen to, the perfect balance between songs that will for sure make you want to dance, and calmer songs with catchy melodies. It is the kind of album that you rediscover each time you listen to and don’t get sick of.
