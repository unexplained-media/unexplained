      Unexplained is a media about diversity in the field of arts and culture. This means diversity in artistic practices (such as music, photography, dancing, illustration and many more!); but also diversity in the origins of the content shared. As a european, I realized that as much art as I was consuming, well it was still very european-centered (what a surprise!) I try as much as I can to share art from all parts of the world, and show the diversity and richness we can find in arts across the globe. Unexplained is also about giving a voice to different artists and putting a light on different local scenes, trying to better understand the experience of art and its creation wherever it is.
