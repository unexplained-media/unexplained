      <h2>About </h2>
        <p>I moved to the Hague in 2019, and starting to meet some the local cultural scene,
          <br>I realized that my desire to share about arts and culture was stronger than ever.
          <br>Personally being interested in a great diversity of artistic practices and styles,
          <br>I wanted through this media, to shed light on local, sometimes underground artists,
          <br>and also show a diversity of artists, from all over the world, and from eclectic practices. </p>
