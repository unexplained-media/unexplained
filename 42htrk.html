        After a very productive year in 2019 with the release of two albums, the group from Melbourne comes back end of 2021 with its new album "Rhinestones".
        <br>
        <br>
        Their previous release "Over the Rainbow" was very ambient, it had no vocals and way more of an electronic sound to it. For this album, the band seems to be getting closer to the sound of their early 2019 release "Venus in Leo".
        <br>
        Jonnine Standish continues providing us her dreamy and fragile vocals which she's known for, which you could already appreciate in previous releases. Alongside the vocals, a guitar, with the clearest sound playing both intimate and moving melodies. The vocals and the guitar really take the center place in the music this time and complement each other perfectly.

        This duality of the vocals and the guitar are supported and enhanced by a subtle production and a pretty impressive work on the guitar. Its sound is so clear and yet it is hard to tell, is it one guitar playing, maybe two? Maybe it is one playing whose sound has been duplicated, and yet its sound is so organic. More than hearing the melodies, you can also hear the fingers moving along the fret as if this guitar was playing right in front of you. Unfolds an interesting duality between the digitally modified composition and the organic and pure energe that comes out of it.
        <br>
        The echos that you can find all throughout the album that has become quite characteristic of HTRK music by now truly add depth to the whole music and give a dreamy feeling to the album.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall the music just feels well balanced, and although fine and elegant, it is still full of emotions. I personally had not listened to an album where the music felt so right in a while and the more I listen to it, the more I seem to be findings things about it that I like.
