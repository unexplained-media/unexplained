        The first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about the Berlin-based label “Habibi Funk” is “digging culture”. Focusing on the music of the Arab world, Habibi Funk goes on the fantastic search of tapes to share the work of talented artists across the Middle East and North Africa.
        <br>
        The label also has a network of people working for them based in Casablanca, Cairo, Tripolis or Khartoum. You can feel that the music you listen to at Habibi Funk is the result of encounters, friends sharing music together and findings brought up by local diggers.

        The mentality of the label is not about pretending to release “undiscovered” or “lost” records that only continue a “white-saviour” and patronizing narrative. It is about sharing the great discoveries of a culture in which you are just a guest, and making it more available to a different public. Music from the Arab world does not need Habibi Funk to exist, but it is definitely a great door to take to get an introduction on the talents of the region.

          If you would like to know how Habibi Funk manages to release those albums and get in contact with the artists, you should definitely go read the description under each release on Bandcamp, it is quite fascinating.
          On top of giving background information and a bunch of references, which are really insightful for those not particularly familiar with music from the Arab world; those descriptions, explaining the process behind each record always, make you feel like you are traveling there with them, imagining the encounters, conversations and atmospheres.

          The label has issued 16 releases at the time I am writing this, and have selected my 3 favourites so you have somewhere to start!

          <b>Habibi Funk 003: Musique Originale de Films</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          This one is a re-edition of one of Ahmed Malek’s albums. Originally from Algiers, he was a recognized musician and composer, also writing music for movies and documentaries. I was directly taken away by this music making your body slowly move to the sound of the melodies like wind in the dunes.
