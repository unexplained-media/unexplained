    <h2>Olympic Nightingale - La vie, quoi d'autre</h2>

    <div class="article-text">
    This post is going to be a bit more personal, because it is about the music of someone I’m very close to, that person being my dad! More than being a music recommendation, it's some kind of portrait, the portrait of the person that taught me how to appreciate music. I remember when I was just a kid, whenever he would come up with new music, he would sit me down; "listen to this and tell me what you think".He would hand me over those huge headphones that would entirely cover my ears, and had the clearest sound no airpods could ever reproduce.

      I was young, probably around 10 when my dad started showing me his music; and to be very honest it wasn't the kind of music I used to listen to. It was dark electronic music, with a heavy bass, and whatever else he was feeling at that moment: some distorted recordings that he had taken in the street, a crazy synthesizer, some mysterious voices from a movie. It wasn't my style, and yet I already knew how to appreciate it. I appreciated it because that music told a story, it created images in my head while I was listening to it.
      <br>
      <br>My dad's music has never been famous, and he is probably the most underground artist I will ever know. Promoting himself has never been its thing, and he'd rather wait for things to come naturally. So being the good daughter that I am, this is my attempt to make him the publicity he deserves.
      His music is at the intersection of industrial, electronic or noise music. To put it simply, you’ll find a lot of heavy rhythms, a series of responses between dirty guitar and outer space electronic melodies, some echoey voices from movie extracts. The music, more than being about what it is composed of, is about its quite unconventional evolution. It gives this almost confusing feeling, and you have to see where it is going to lead you.

      I also happened to have created the last two album covers, all the previous ones were done by my mom, so it has always been a family production!
      There is no link to any instagram account this time, but you can easily find his music on bandcamp, and will have the link to the last album in my bio.
