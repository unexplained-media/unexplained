        I wanted to talk about this project because this is one of the rare recent music projects where I felt like the music was totally unpredictable. This project is a trip in between varying instrumentals going from soul beats to darker and more floating melodies. With dreamy echoes and loose pronunciation, Obongjayar’s voice, recognizable by its special intonation, takes an important place in his music. This short project, only 16 minutes long, feels like listening to different albums at the same time, getting plunged into the artist’s universe instantly. Special note to his recent project that came out in february 2020, Which way is forward, less eclectic sonorities, lighter atmosphere, but that is really good as well.
