      <h3>Recommending: Di-Meh</h3>
      <h4>MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="39di-mhe.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/38DIMEH.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>I already knew about Di-Meh’s music for a couple of years but recently I got to take a closer look at his work, listening to his last release “Mektoub”.I started listening to the album without any expectations, really. I knew him for his explosive style, as much in his flow as in the instrumentals (crazy basses especially) and thought it was pretty much all I was going to get out of the experience...</p>

      <h3>Recommending: Donna Dimi</h3>
      <h4>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h4>
      <a href="38donnadimi.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/38DONNADIMI.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>If I had to choose a word to describe Donna’s work I think I would choose the word “subtle”. You can find a lot of color gradients, geometric shapes and curvy lines giving the work a surreal feeling, which are often balanced out by more natural elements such as bodies, hands, faces, flowers. There is a really interesting contrast between...</p>

      <p>Selections of new and 2nd hand records, a great diversity of genres, an important presence online with different content on facebook and instagram, also curating cultural events, small concerts, parties or online dj sets.

      <h4>MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="36charifmegabarne.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/36CAE.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>The composition in itself was quite minimalistic, it was just rhythmics on drums and a clear guitar sound. However I was immediately hooked by the energy coming out of their performance, letting yourself be taken away by the flow created by those fast percussions and guitar melodies...</p>

      <h3>Recommending: OH MU</h3>
      <h4>ILLUSTRATION</h4>
      <a href="35ohmu.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/35OHMU.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>Today I want to write about the colourful illustrations of OH MU, an artist originally from Switzerland and Italy currently based in France. OH MU is an artist of many talents since they also do music production and songwriting which I invite you to check out as well, but I will mainly focus on the illustration aspect here...</p>

      <a href="34habibifunk.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/34HABIBIFUNK.jpg" alt="Cairo"</a>
      <p>The first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about the Berlin-based label “Habibi Funk” is “digging culture”. Focusing on the music of the Arab world, Habibi Funk goes on the fantastic search of tapes to share the work of talented artists across the Middle East and North Africa...</p>

      <h4>PAINTING & MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="32sarahibrahim.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/32SARAHIBRAHIM.jpg" alt="Sarah Ibrahim"</a>
      <p>I have first encountered her work through the series “4th of August”, a series focusing on the consequences of the explosion that happened in Beirut’s harbour. I directly noticed her work by its vibrant colors and its detailed lining. Looking at it felt like being transported to another universe, one of intense colors, perspectives and well chosen details...</p>

Already having two EPs behind her, “Sensi” and “RISING” respectively released in 2018 and 2019, she has been releasing mainly singles until now...</p>

      <h4>MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="30madlib.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/30MADLIB.jpg" alt="Madlib"</a>
      <p>Today I wanted to talk about an album that I have been enjoying lately: the last album of Madlib “Sound Ancestors”. The vibe of this album reminds me of the fantastic albums of J Dilla (who was also Madlib’s friend), composed of a bunch of loops and samples magically coming together into a coherent whole...</p>

      <h3>9 sountrack composers for a diverse representation</h3>
      <h4>MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="28soundtrackcomposers.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/28SOUNDTRACKCOMPOSERS.jpg" alt="9 soundtrack composers"</a>
      <p>From the many underrated things that exist on this planet, I believe soundtrack composers have to be considered as one of them. I am always so surprised and amazed when I discover a new soundtrack composer. How come a vast majority of us have never heard their names although they play such an important role in creating a univers...</p>

      <p>Fernanda Peralta is an illustrator based in Sao Paulo and first encountered her work going through a zine on Tarsila do Amaral for Common Threads press. I was completely seduced by her oniric universe close to vegetation and nature...</p>

      <h4>MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="26ndexit.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/262NDEXIT.jpg" alt="2nd exit"</a>
      <p>With its incredibly sweet sound, “2nd” exit is an album (and also the name of the duo) I keep coming back to. With soothing voices, sometimes singing sometimes almost speaking, light rhytmics and melodies, its composition, overall quite minimalistic, will make you feel like you are...</p>
