      <a href="43beyapanicha.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/43BEYAPANICHA.jpg" alt="Artwork by Beya Panicha"</a>
      <p>As I was reading through the last edition of Gaze Magazine (features works of many talented women, definitely recommend), I came across the work of Beya Panicha, an illustrator and painter from Thailand. Vibrant colors and grainy textures, Beya's universe feels like she...</p>

      <p>Jonnine Standish continues providing us her dreamy and fragile vocals which she's known for, which you could already appreciate in previous releases. Alongside the vocals, a guitar, with the clearest sound playing both intimate and moving melodies. The vocals and the guitar really take the center place in the music...</p>

      <a href="41electronicmusicalbums.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/41ELECTRODANCESELECTION.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>It has been a while since electronic music overall has been mentioned here so I wanted to share a selection of 5 albums that I have been really liking lately. You probably know the drill by now, some are more industrial and heavy, some more ambient, some more “electronic”, the selection is as diverse as possible to try to represent as many ...<p>

      <p>Fuco Ueda’s universe feels like entering a daydream; a world of female silhouettes, flowers and animals, where air blends with water as if they were one, and where time seems to be going slower than it ever will, here, on planet earth...</p>

      <p>I already knew about Di-Meh’s music for a couple of years but recently I got to take a closer look at his work, listening to his last release “Mektoub”.I started listening to the album without any expectations, really. I knew him for his explosive style, as much in his flow as in the instrumentals (crazy basses especially) and thought it was pretty much all I was going to get out of the experience...</p>

      <a href="38donnadimi.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/38DONNADIMI.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>If I had to choose a word to describe Donna’s work I think I would choose the word “subtle”. You can find a lot of color gradients, geometric shapes and curvy lines giving the work a surreal feeling, which are often balanced out by more natural elements such as bodies, hands, faces, flowers. There is a really interesting contrast between...</p>

      <p>Selections of new and 2nd hand records, a great diversity of genres, an important presence online with different content on facebook and instagram, also curating cultural events, small concerts, parties or online dj sets.

      <p>The composition in itself was quite minimalistic, it was just rhythmics on drums and a clear guitar sound. However I was immediately hooked by the energy coming out of their performance, letting yourself be taken away by the flow created by those fast percussions and guitar melodies...</p>

      <p>Today I want to write about the colourful illustrations of OH MU, an artist originally from Switzerland and Italy currently based in France. OH MU is an artist of many talents since they also do music production and songwriting which I invite you to check out as well, but I will mainly focus on the illustration aspect here...</p>

      <p>The first thing that comes to my mind when thinking about the Berlin-based label “Habibi Funk” is “digging culture”. Focusing on the music of the Arab world, Habibi Funk goes on the fantastic search of tapes to share the work of talented artists across the Middle East and North Africa...</p>

      <p>I have first encountered her work through the series “4th of August”, a series focusing on the consequences of the explosion that happened in Beirut’s harbour. I directly noticed her work by its vibrant colors and its detailed lining. Looking at it felt like being transported to another universe, one of intense colors, perspectives and well chosen details...</p>

      <p>Today I wanted to talk about an album that I have been enjoying lately: the last album of Madlib “Sound Ancestors”. The vibe of this album reminds me of the fantastic albums of J Dilla (who was also Madlib’s friend), composed of a bunch of loops and samples magically coming together into a coherent whole...</p>

      <p>From the many underrated things that exist on this planet, I believe soundtrack composers have to be considered as one of them. I am always so surprised and amazed when I discover a new soundtrack composer. How come a vast majority of us have never heard their names although they play such an important role in creating a univers...</p>

      <p>With its incredibly sweet sound, “2nd” exit is an album (and also the name of the duo) I keep coming back to. With soothing voices, sometimes singing sometimes almost speaking, light rhytmics and melodies, its composition, overall quite minimalistic, will make you feel like you are...</p>
