        <h2>Little Simz - GREY Area</h2>

      <div class="article-text">
        I haven’t talked about rap so much here yet, so I’m very happy to start with a very talented rapper, being no other than Little Simz. I discovered her with her album “GREY Area”, and I got hooked up immediately. Some breaking beats that will make your head bounce a 100%, a cold voice and a perfectly mastered flow, all of this topped up by strong lyrics. The diversity of the instrumentals of each song shows you the adaptability of her flow and how wide her universe is.

          A minimalist melody and a funky bass on “Sherbet Sunset”, a beautiful piano on “Pressure”, drums and violins on “Venom”, the list can go on. The diversity of the music doesn’t mean that it lacks cohesion though, it’s actually quite the opposite. The entire album is produced by Inflo, a Londonian producer which explains why the album comes together so well (go check out one of his rare singles “No Fear”, it’s very good, super groovy).  Overall it’s energetic, some egotrip here and there, sometimes slower and deep. Listening to her album makes you feel like she has everything under control, which might not be too far from the truth since all of her music has been released on her own independent label “Age 101 Music”. The album really forms a whole and is always a safe play.

          For her new EP, “Drop 6”, Little Simz comes at it again. Except for the first song that is quite fast speed and kicking, I felt like this EP has slightly lighter melodies with a slower flow than what we could hear in “GREY Area”. It has quite a refreshing vibe and makes me wonder what the evolution of Little Simz is going to look like.
