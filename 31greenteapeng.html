        Originally from London, Greentea Peng started releasing music 3 years ago and is coming up with her first album "Man Made" this summer, in June 2021. Already having two EPs behind her, “Sensi” and “RISING” respectively released in 2018 and 2019, she has been releasing mainly singles until now.

        The first thing I noticed and liked about her music was her voice, quite unique and recognizable amongst many. It is actually quite hard to describe, it is a clear and confident voice, but also strong and delicate at the same time. It just feels like the perfect balance between speaking and singing.

        Listening more closely to her music, I was impressed by the diverse influences in her music. Bossa Nova melodies on “Hu Man”, jazzy arrangements and old school scratches on “Nah It Ain’t The Same”, reggaeton like rhythmics on “Spells”, reggae atmosphere on “Revolution”; it feels like Greentea Peng is proving us that she can adapt to any instrumentals, and I have to say I really believe she can.
        She manages to completely reinterpret every style and make it fit into her own universe. You can already hear a signature sound which is quite impressive considering her first releases were only 3 years ago.

        I can not talk about Greentea Peng without mentioning her video clips which feel like an important part of her musical universe as well. There is usually not so much of a story line, but it is more about aesthetics and getting in her visual universe. There is always something mesmerizing about them, often playing with effects or transitions, adding to that her many tattoos and unique outfits which are already a vibe on their own. The sceneries found in her video clips, often portraying a blend of nature and urban environments make you forget your reality for a few minutes.
