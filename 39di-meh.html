      <h2>Recommending: Di-Meh</h2>

        I already knew about Di-Meh’s music for a couple of years but recently I got to take a closer look at his work, listening to his last release “Mektoub”. I started listening to the album without any expectations, really. I knew him for his explosive style, as much in his flow than in his instrumentals (crazy basses especially) and thought it was pretty much all I was going to get out of the experience.

        This is where I was wrong though. It had been a long time since I had not listened to an album, especially a rap album, that caught my attention from beginning to end in such a way. The album is nuanced, you can find incredible bangers as much as calmer songs, and the combination of those is made really wisely throughout the album.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also noticed that my experience of the album was evolving every time which was a feeling I used to have a lot when I was younger and used to only listen to albums. This feeling when you listen to an album for the first time and are going to like a certain set of songs in the album, and the more you listen to it and the more you start getting drawn to songs that did not catch your attention in the first place. It really feels like you are unlocking levels, as if some songs needed a bit more time and patience to release their magic to the one who’s listening.

          I was also struck by the quality of the instrumentals. It might be a question of personal preferences but the choices of melodies spoke to me, and you could definitely spend hours listening to every single detail that makes the song what it is, and what gave me the feeling I was truly entering the artist’s universe.
          You can definitely hear many influences in the music as well, from US rap, to the multicultural upbringing he experienced in Geneva or Middle Eastern music thanks to his Moroccan-Algerian origins and it is really interesting to hear how they all blend together.

          For the French speakers I definitely recommend watching his interview with Grunt “Opus - Di-Meh and Crew” retracing a big part of the creative process behind Mektoub and his career, all of this through a discussion with Di-Meh of course, but also with other artists and friends of Di-Meh such as Limsa d’Aulnay, Gracy Hopkins and Criss.
