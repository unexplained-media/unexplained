    <h2>Horatio Luna - Boom Boom</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Horatio Luna is a bassist, producer, composer based in Melbourne, Australia, which recently came out with a new album, Boom Boom. The first thing I noticed is the bass really at the forefront of the album. It's quite rare to see this instrument take such a predominant place in music and is quite refreshing to hear. It has a super funky rhythm, which reminds me of Tom Misch’s guitar style sometimes. The bass is complemented with super bouncy and fast rhythmics, be aware of your neck! Overall it’s quite hard to know how to describe the music style of this album; it feels like house music always backed up with a very jazzy feeling and some hip hop vibes. It’s really interesting to hear how those different music genres can come together.</p>

        <p>Melbourne has a very important jazz scene and just like this album, it's very free and open, you can definitely hear the many influences coming from hip-hop, soul or even club and house music. If you want to hear more in this style, Brownswood records came up with a compilation album featuring many artists of the Melbourne jazz scene called “Sunny Side Up”, which is very good. The other artists on that label are also real talented, you should give it a listen!</p>
