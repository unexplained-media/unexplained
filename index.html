      <h3>Recommending: Di-Meh</h3>
      <h4>MUSIC</h4>

      <p>I already knew about Di-Meh’s music for a couple of years but recently I got to take a closer look at his work, listening to his last release “Mektoub”.I started listening to the album without any expectations, really. I knew him for his explosive style, as much in his flow as in the instrumentals (crazy basses especially) and thought it was pretty much all I was going to get out of the experience...</p>

      <h3>Recommending: Donna Dimi</h3>
      <h4>GRAPHIC DESIGN</h4>
      <a href="38donnadimi.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/38DONNADIMI.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>If I had to choose a word to describe Donna’s work I think I would choose the word “subtle”.

      <h3>Recommending: Charif Megabarne</h3>
      <h4>MUSIC</h4>
      <a href="36charifmegarbane.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/36CAE.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>The composition in itself was quite minimalistic, it was just rhythmics on drums and a clear guitar sound. However I was immediately hooked by the energy coming out of their performance, letting yourself be taken away by the flow created by those fast percussions and guitar melodies...</p>
