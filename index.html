      <a href="40fucoueda.html"><img class="index-img-1" src="images/40FUCOUEDA.jpg" alt="pic by Lou Touyarou"</a>
      <p>Fuco Ueda’s universe feels like entering a daydream; a world of female silhouettes, flowers and animals, where air blends with water as if they were one, and where time seems to be going slower than it ever will, here, on planet earth...</p>
