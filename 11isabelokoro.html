    <h2>Isabel Okoro</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Isabel Okoro is a Nigerian artist based in between Toronto and Lagos. Known for her photographs, her work as she stated in her interview for Sukeban magazine, “focuses on Black experience and tries to bridge the gap between the motherland and the diaspora”. One of her last projects, Eternity, is her own “personal visualization of a Black utopia”, “creating an imagery of egalitarian ideals while showcasing the humanity of black people that is often stripped away from us”. Apart from the very important message that is shared through her art, Isabel’s pictures have a very special feeling to them, a very soft touch. Sometimes a bit blurry, sometimes on the beach, with the sun, looking at her pictures feels calming, like taking a breath of fresh air.
