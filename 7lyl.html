    <h2>Lyl radio</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p><a href="https://lyl.live/">Lyl radio</a> is a webradio founded in 2014 in Lyon, which later expanded its locals to Paris in 2016 and to Brussels in 2020. Apart from being a webradio, it has quite a wide range of activities, and also participates in the creation of many events, concerts or music installations. I think this radio is especially incredible for the diversity of content it proposes. Right now you can find more or less 180 shows that stream live music regularly, proposing any kind or genre of music. What’s cool is that you can also listen to shows that have already passed by just searching for the specific show you want to listen to, which doesn’t necessarily constrain you in the live radio format. Special note to the show I have discovered the radio with, <a href="https://lyl.live/show/lyl-de-la-tentation">“Lyl de la tentation”</a>, focusing on reggae and dub music. It is hosted by the french actor Finnegan Oldfield, and has some absolute gems in there! You should definitely check it out if you want to expand your knowledge on that kind of music. </p>
