    <h2>Maria Medem</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>María Medem is a spanish illustrator originally from Sevilla in Spain. Her work can be described as quite minimalistic, where colours definitely take up an important space. Characterized by stunning degrades and very vibrant colours, she mainly uses risograph painting in her work (this technique is known to create very intense colours and thick textures). You can always find this sort of grain effect in her illustrations that really makes it its own thing. There is a very poetic atmosphere to her work, always including the sky, the clouds or the sun at some point; it’s usually quite focused on landscapes or nature. There is quite a calm and airy feeling coming out of her illustrations, and the characters are often represented with a kind of melancholic solitude expression. Her work has been getting more and more recognition through the years making illustrations for different articles for example, including some of the New York Times, but publishing her own illustration books as well.  Maria also animates some of her illustrations, which can lead sometimes to the creation of video clips. This is the case of the song Mr. Lee by Hovvdy, which video clip is realized by Maria. The diversity of her work and its unique universe is definitely worth following.</p>
