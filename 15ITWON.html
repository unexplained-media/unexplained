      <b>Was there a specific moment, an artist that made you think “wow I really want to make music as well’, or was it a desire that developed more naturally?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I don’t really know how to answer this, I’ve always had music on the radio at home. There is not necessarily something that created this desire to make music.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>So nothing that really triggered it?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      No not really, or maybe when electronic music really became a thing, with techno etc, I thought to myself “maybe with a computer, I can also create something”. But back then I had no money, no computer, and when I left to India, I worked just to be able to buy myself a computer, some programs, and start like this, completely self-taught. So maybe that was something that triggered it, but it wasn’t one specific moment or artist.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>We’ve sometimes talked about being self taught, as much on the composition than on the production and how it represents a huge amount of work to do both at the same time. Do you sometimes wish that you had some kind of formation or someone that explained to you how stuff worked, or do you think being self-taught brings you something else that balances those negative aspects?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      In my case, I arrived in India, I worked, I earned a bit of money to buy a computer, I didn’t even know how it really worked, sound cards, music programs, etc. I got it from the black market with cracked programs, and there was this one guy that I knew a bit, that came to my place for one afternoon before leaving Delhi for good, and that showed me a bit how it worked. So concretely in one afternoon he could barely show me anything, so it’s really the only formation I got. So definitely I would have liked to have something more concrete like a formation or someone that could advise me. It’s not only a matter of time, but also creating better work. During all those years, I’ve made music, albums, they all had a default, and usually I was very aware of it. I was simply not capable of reaching the result that I wanted and it’s really frustrating. In my opinion I’ve done 15 years of complete crap.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>So you do not see anything positive in being self-taught?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I could understand it with someone that plays an instrument, because he’s going to develop a very personal way of playing and he's going to play stuff like no one else can. However with a program where you’re basically supposed to do sound production, what happens is that you don’t know how to attain the sound you want to attain. A self-taught guitarist can make a song, comes up with a weird melody, it’s cool because it’s original, but afterwards it’s someone’s job to make it sound nice, and that person is a professional. So when you’re 100% self-taught, you make music in a weird way because you don’t really control anything, but it’s also going to sound weird and quite cheap. It’s a shame. I hear that people make albums in their rooms, when I do an album in my room, it’s crap.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>But you’ve been making albums in your room for 20 years now!</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Yes and I still do, but I’m making albums in my room like some guy makes a lofi album with a guitar. But when it’s lofi it’s nice because there’s a melody, it’s fragile, there’s something interesting. When you do this with machines that aspect isn’t there anymore, it just sounds cheap. I still don’t know how they do it. Do they make the composition and then send it to someone else that will work on the mastering, the production, that will make it sound properly? Or do they have the tools and the knowledge to do it? I’ve started playing a bit of guitar, but overall all of my sounds come from my computer. So do other people really work like me or not? Maybe I’m completely leaving aside some aspects of the process. Or maybe they get help at some point. I had a friend that made indus albums, and he was telling me “All of that aspect really annoys me. I make my music, I compose it, and then I send all of it to another guy that is going to work on it, and make it sound right”. Personally, it’s not really with the composition that I struggle with, it’s more with how it sounds later on. That’s what I’m working on to try to resolve that problem and make sure it sounds decent. But I still wonder how others do it.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>It’s funny, in 20 years of creation, you’ve never met anyone else that makes electronic music?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      No, I don't really mention it, I do it for myself. I’ve lived in places where it’s maybe hard to meet people. I don’t evolve in musical environments, and I’m really out of any movement that might exist.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>So you have your own musical environment.</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Yeah.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Do you like it that way?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I did until now. But I realised that maybe I had lost some time. That maybe everything that I’ve been creating for the past 20 years could have been better. I imagine everyone says that though. Every group after 15 or 20 years feel like they play better, but the fans still prefer the first albums.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Isn’t thinking like this just being perfectionist? Cause you could have had a better sound and you could have found something else that you wished you were doing better.</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Yes, it’s true, you can’t really know. If you ask some rock bands, they’ll tell you they’ve never been that good, and their best albums are their first ones, and it’s often the case. So I might be completely wrong about this. But this is the stage I’m personally in at the moment.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>I remember when I was a kid, you always had this small microphone with you, and you would record sounds in the street, bits from here and there that you would later add in your music. I don’t feel like it’s something you do so much now. Did you find some kind of inspiration in the streets at that moment? Is it something that still inspires now ?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      It is true that in the beginning, I did record sounds in the streets but we were living in India, and over there sounds were completely crazy to me. I would record sounds during the day, I would record sounds during the night. I would chill on the balcony when it was silent, but we were living in India so when it’s silent, you could still hear the noise of all the aircons, the birds singing, millions of things. In the morning, there were all the street vendors, when we went to markets there was folk music everywhere. So yeah, there were billions of sounds that for me were completely unusual. I was going to say exotic but it almost has a negative connotation now, but I found those sounds crazy and I wanted to use them. So I would play with them and put them in my music.
      <br>Especially at that moment I didn’t use rhythmics, or at least no drum box so the rhythmics were created by the samples I was using. It was a complete other approach, it had a real relevance. At some point we left India for European countries, sounds there are the ones I know and that I’ve always known, they weren’t that fun to me. I still record some of them, coffee machines, washing machines, a bit of the metro, some voices in the street, but it’s not like in India where everything was crazy, and most particularly where sound is very important.
      <br>When we talk about India we mention smells, colors, but sounds also have an incredible saturation. In Europe it’s less the case, so I still record some of them, but it’s more sporadic. Adding to the fact that the music I make also follows a certain evolution, I started using a drum box which makes less space for all those other sounds. I still use old samples sometimes, but they are there to punctuate rather than really being at the base of the music like it used to in the past.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>In what sense would you say that sound is important in India?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      It’s not that it’s important, but it’s constantly present, all the time. The morning the first thing you hear is sellers in the street shouting “shabjiwala, shabjiwala!”, and those guys are singing and it’s there all the time. When you go to craft markets, there are folk bands playing everywhere. It’s hard to explain but we were living in a place where we could hear the sound of the peacocks shouting, sounds are constantly around. It was really exciting to use because I wasn’t used to those sounds, so to record and use them was really fun. I personally come from a European urban environment. I know the sounds, I grew up with them, they intrigue me less. That doesn’t mean I stop myself from using those sounds, which I do from times to times.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>But you didn’t find that in other asian countries we went to like Thailand for example?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      In Thailand no, because Bangkok is a city where there are a lot of cars, which is also the case in India, but there wasn’t really any kind of wildlife to hear. That thing was really less present. Maybe I just left that approach after India and became less interested. But I don’t think so. The first time I went to Thailand, I had that same microphone and I recorded a lot of things and got really interesting sounds. When I went back, I mean I’m always aware, looking for it, thinking about it even if I’m not recording, and I wasn’t really called out.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> So do you think it’s how cities have evolved that make them less interesting?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I do think there is a part of truth in this. We’re living in super urban environments, it’s more common to what we know. Whereas when we were in Delhi, it was really urban, but it was still a city where there were monkeys, vultures. You could also find that wildlife in the rest. It was jolty, chaotic; sounds went along and I found that really interesting.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Until now you would make music without really thinking about it, you opened the music software and would kinda play around. Not long ago you told me that for the first time you had a precise idea of what you wanted in mind. Do you know what suddenly created that precise idea and if it changed your way of making music?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Let’s say that before I would let myself go with the music. It did not matter if it was a sound I had recorded, a drum box, something stupid, I would do something with it, put it, create some repetition and I would start from there. In some way, it’s weird to say this because it’s not entirely the case, but it’s as if there was some improvisation, or at least a spontaneity. I let things happen almost against my will, working from one sound to another, I turn them around and let myself be carried away by the machines. It’s something that was pretty crazy to me because you really have no idea where you’re heading. And it’s true that lately, I’ve spent a lot of time on it, I started mastering some aspects, and for the first time I told myself “ what if you tried to do music in that particular style “. Indeed when I say “in a particular style”, I don’t necessarily manage to attain it, so there is the first intention and there is what you get in the end. Let’s say I thought about it more than I used to and I find it fun. Is it really different? I guess it is, but that doesn’t really matter, that’s the process. What’s important is to create a song that is good. So yeah I did it that way, but maybe I’m going to end up not liking that song and leave it aside.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>3 artists you would like to give a special mention to?</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      I would say Keven Martin in all of his possible interventions. Him in solo, with the 5 or 6 albums we made this year that are all incredible, or The Bug obviously, Zonal and King Midas Sound.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>What is it that makes you like him so much? You mention him quite often, and I really like his music as well, but what is it that makes you such a fan of his work? Because since he’s doing music in solo, but also under other names it varies quite a bit from one to the other.</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Well it got to a point where I don’t even know if he ended up shaping some of my music tastes or if I can relate to his, which would explain why I like all of his different incarnations, because I like everything he makes. I don’t know, I read his interviews, and I feel like that guy has a thing. For example he says that he likes every music style, but that in each style what he really likes is the two percent that is left aside, without as much attention. I can relate to that kind of thinking, he likes what is imperfect, what is original. I don’t really know how to explain it because in the past 20 years, everytime I can relate. And again, once more, he released an ambient album. Usually I don’t particularly dislike ambient but I always find it a bit boring, but in this case I don’t know it was just the right timing and I liked it. And it was really incredible.
      <br>
      <br>So yeah Kevin Martin and then not too far I would say Justin Broadrick, his partner in Zonal, that’s also in Godflesh. It’s really crazy, with brutality, anger, darkness. I really like it, and when he’s in techno mode under the name of JK Flesh, it’s the same. He makes basic techno, very brutal and it’s really interesting. He really has something that makes him different and I feel drawn to it.
      <br>
      <br>And to finish off, it’s not going to be an artist because I could mention billions, it’s more symptomatic of what is currently happening, it’s Nyege Nyege Tapes (record label based in Uganda). They are creating a crazy mix of people in Africa but not only because there are even guys from Europe doing some residencies there. I think that effervescence is really amazing, and I love many of their artists, the last one being Douma but there are many others in other styles. Right now I’ve been really loving that movement because it’s the best of what you can bring with all the transnational connections we have with the internet; even though there is also a physical part to it as well because people are doing residencies and they meet each other. But it kinda blurs the lines, adding the fact that it comes from a quite unexpected place in terms of production of electronic music, and I think it’s awesome.
