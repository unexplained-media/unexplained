    <h2>민현우 Min Hyun Woo</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>민현우 Min Hyun Woo is primarily known as a fashion photographer, but his work is definitely not limited to that! His recent works involve a very cool series for Vogue Korea, portraying old women dressed in traditional Korean clothes; but also a beautiful series “ We are gonna live this summer”, focused mainly on humans within nature and water. Although he is currently based in Seoul, 민현우 Min Hyun Woo has grown up in a Korean village, that goes by the name of Samcheok. I think you can definitely see it in the way nature is portrayed and the calm feeling that emanates from his pictures. It feels like the camera gets so many details, portraying the beauty of the small things. A lot of his work can be seen on his instagram page, it is definitely worth a look!</p>
