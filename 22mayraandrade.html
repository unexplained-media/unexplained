      <h2>Mayra Andrade</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="article-text">
        I recently discovered the singer and musician Mayra Andrade, originally from Cape Verde, she has lived abroad quite a lot and has lived in countries such as Senegal, Angola, Germany, France and is now settled in Lisbon.
        I really like her last album "Manga", it has quite a modern sound to it, with rhythmics that reminded me of afrobeat and even trap music sometimes, always very catchy; and a way of producing the album that sounds very clean and sharp. However at the same time you will find some percussions, as well as guitar and piano melodies that appear from time to time, that feel very organic. I personally love the contrast and is really what kept my curiosity throughout the whole album.

          Most importantly she has a beautiful voice, clear, steady and melodious. She sings mainly in Cape Verdean Creole, although I know she has a few songs in French as well, and is known to invite musicians from all horizons to make music together.
          <br>The album comes really well together, and gives me the feeling that every good album gives me this impression of entering a new world, following a story and being led in pleasantly surprising places.
          I also wanted to add that she has a live presence that I find quite impressive. I am not necessarily talking about concerts, but even shows on youtube such as Colors, I have to say I was really mesmerized every time I have seen her!
