    <h2>Sweely</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Sweely is a French producer of house music, currently based in Lyon, most known for its 2019 release “Beauty is Random”. Through some crazy breaking beats, the album takes us back to the time where we could dance together. The album naturally changes atmospheres, with an interesting mix of songs with a very chill hiphop atmosphere, and others with harder electronic melodies. Overall a very good house album, with a dancy and light feeling. Sweely continues down that path with his first self-release project “Don’t push it too far” that came out last October. That album has definitely more of a retro sound to it, and really makes me wonder if Sweely hasn’t merged with Snoop Dog and J Dilla while making it (go listen to “Gin and Juice” from Snoop and then listen to the album, you’ll see what I mean!). It is a type of sound I personally haven’t heard a lot of in recent releases, and Sweely does a brilliant job at bringing it back.</p>
