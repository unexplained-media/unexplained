    <h2>Leo Walk & La Marche Bleue</h2>
    <div class="article-text">
      <p>Leo walk is a French dancer and artist, and I have been following his work since I discovered him in his interview for Clique. He started dancing when he was just a kid, initially with breakdance, but his style has evolved a lot since then. Incorporating elements of different styles of dance, Leo Walk has managed to create a style on his own. Playing with shapes, gravity, shadows, also incorporating backgrounds and architecture, there is a real energy and poetry coming out of his projects. A special reference to the videos he made working with the director Neels Castillon, that are incredibly poetic, completely out of time.</p>

      <p>La marche bleue is one of his projects, a collective of dancers which recently started performing their first show across french theaters (although corona obviously got in the way). Leo made the choreography but he dances as well, and their work is very close to my heart because it inspires me a lot. If I had to choose one word to describe their universe, it would just be "beautiful". Beyond creating choreographies and a show, they have managed to create an entire universe around their collective. They also touch on painting, clothing, music, what they do is diverse, poetic, with a very strong aesthetic. A universe going from a sweet melancholy to tender summers. A wise choice of colours, each dancer having its own style, creating a beautiful complementarity.
      Overall Leo Walk and his dancers have managed to create a universe out of dancing, complementing it with other means of expression, and are very good at sharing it.
