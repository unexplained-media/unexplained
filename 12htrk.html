    <h2>HTRK - Venus in Leo</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="article-text">
      HTRK is an Australian group originally from Melbourne, now based in London. One of its last albums which I chose to talk about today, Venus in Leo, is more or less at the crossroad of ambient and post punk music. Nigel Yang, driving the clear and echoey guitars, and Jonnine Standish adding her simple but dreamy voice. You add to this some firm rhythmics that help structure the whole. The sound is quite minimalist overall, but this feeling of simplicity (which is probably just a feeling), creating airy and relaxed music makes you wanna hear more.

      Before 2010, they're albums were also created with the help of a 3rd member, Sean Stewart, which unfortunately passed away. If you're looking for a more ambient vibe, with less vocals and heavier guitars, you should definitely look into those older albums, although their last one has more of that vibe as well in my opinion.
