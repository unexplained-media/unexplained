Today I want to address something I think deserves way more attention: production companies. They are such an important aspect of an artist’s visual identity and universe, they truly deserve more recognition for their work. One that particularly caught my attention recently is Bleu Nuit. It’s a Belgian company based in Brussels and let me tell you, their teams are talented. 
I first discovered them watching their project, “What they called me”. It’s a 15min film that came out to support the last outcoming EP of RIMON. I clicked on that video because the thumbnail was beautiful and it clearly did not disappoint. There is a very strong aesthetic, a brilliant use of lighting, powerful script. The makeup, hairstyles and outfits are also an important aspect of their universe.  
After seeing that video I wanted to see more of their work, and I realized I had seen many of their videos before. They have been working a lot with francophone hiphop artists such as Ichon, Swing, Dadju, Maxenss, 7 Jaws, while still keeping the same poetic universe, I definitely recommend checking up what they’re up to.
