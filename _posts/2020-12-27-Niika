To be honest, I first clicked on this album because it had a beautiful cover, not really knowing what to expect from the music itself. I was pleasantly surprised after a few seconds. “Close but not too close”, is the perfect balance between a mesmerizing voice, a clean guitar sound and wise rhythmics. The singer, from her real name Nika Nemirovsky was born in Uzbekistan but spent the rest of her life between Chicago and Brisbane. Going from pop/folk to jazz with hints of bossa nova here and there, it’s pretty hard to pinpoint this album to only one music style, and that’s clearly one of its strengths!
