      <h2>Donna Dimi</h2>

        It has been a while since I haven’t talked about graphic design or illustration here and today’s post will be on Donna Dimi, a talented illustrator based in Chicago originally from Bulgaria.

        If I had to choose a word to describe Donna’s work I think I would choose the word “subtle”. You can find a lot of color gradients, geometric shapes and curvy lines giving the work a surreal feeling, which are often balanced out by more natural elements such as bodies, hands, faces, flowers. There is a really interesting contrast between the softness of the colors, which as mentioned before, often come in gradients and make it appear very smooth to the eye; and the shapes, sometimes explosive, translating a sense of speed, which have a sharper look and appear to take a stronger position in the overall composition.

        Donna also often associates her illustrations with text, sentences or a few words. It is always interesting to see the association of illustration and text, first on a purely visual aspect, and seeing how they can both complement each other in the composition, playing with the typographies, etc. I personally really like the presence of text also because it guides you through the artwork. Being able to associate the illustrations with words gives it a different meaning or interpretation and can really add depth to certain works.

          It also appears that she’s been working more on animation as well which is always a pleasant evolution to see especially with illustrators. Being able to focus more on the movement or on the association with music or sound really adds another perspective to an illustrator’s universe and sheds another light on their work.
